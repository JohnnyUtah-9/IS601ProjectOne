Definition:
----
> "The "clone" command downloads an existing Git repository to your local computer.
 You will then have a full-blown, local version of that Git repo and can start working on the project.
 Typically, the "original" repository is located on a remote server, often from a service like GitHub, 
 Bitbucket, or GitLab). That remote repository's URL is then later referred to as the "origin".'
