####Definition:

"Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. Once installed,
Git can be initialized on a project to create a Git repository."

"A Git repository is the git folder inside of a project.
This repository tracks all of the changes made to the files in your project,
resulting in a completed project history composed of controlled[edited/modified] versions."

### Starting a Git Repository

    * Create a Git repository in one of two ways:

    * Take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository

    * Clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

    * Either way, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine
